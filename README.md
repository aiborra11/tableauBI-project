# TableauBI-project
**Business Intelligence with Tableau**

Overview
The goal of this project is to practice what we have learned in the Business Intelligence chapter. For this project, I will choose a data set, explore it using Tableau, and put together a Story for presentation showing the insights I have derived from the data. Defend and explain the data in the following lesson.  

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
**\nTableau doc:** https://public.tableau.com/profile/alejandro1702#!/vizhome/Tableau-projectAlejandroIborra/Slides

Roadmap I followed for the project:
1. Understand the data provided in the dataset.
2. Find out and determine the main businesses areas for the company.
3. Figure out the relevance of every line of the business in relation to the the main business area.
4. Economic figures of the company.
5. Who are the most important customers? Find out why.
6. Determine the areas where the company should keep investing and where they should stop investing or redefine the business line. i.e.: Is it worthy to invest in converting loyal customers into very loyal? Can we extrapolate it into other business lines?
7. How is the company's performance evolving? Use churn? Who are the customers who are abandoning the business? When? How and how much the company should invest in retaining these customers?
